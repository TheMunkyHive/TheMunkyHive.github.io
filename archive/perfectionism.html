<div class="entry">
<p>
Every child is influenced by their parents. Like them i have high expectations about life, other
people and especially myself. I always felt that beeing a perfectionist isnt easy and that it is
paralyzing and blocking me in every aspect of my life.
</p>
<p>
I never really thought about it. I just accepted the fact and waited until the feeling of beeing
paralyzed went away. Lately ive picked up the thought and analyzed it because it hinders me to live
my life the way i want it to be.
</p>
<p>
To put the <em>challenge</em>, thats how i call my problems, in simple words: Whenever i have a
wonderfull idea i just refuse to get started because i instantly fall to my perfectionist nature.
The reason why i dont even start is simple, my expectations about the outcome are to high.
</p>
<p>
Recently i was reading a blog post about a woman who taught herself to become a designer in 6 month
without attending design school. Amongst all the many advices and tip she was giving, one thing
stuck with me. She said: work, paint, design and <strong>KILL YOUR WORK</strong>. Yes work as hard as
you  can, produce alot of results and then destroy your work.
</p>
<p>
The reason why she was mentioning this important fact is the following. When you are starting with
something you are  usually not very good in it. You will eventually master your art/job whatever you
are doing by investing alot of time on it. But you can not evolve if you can't let go. The process of
creation is not a sprint, it is a marathon and takes alot of time and effort.
</p>
<p>
Attachment to your work is an emotion which is a bond that distracts you and limits your capability to
focus on new things/ideas/concepts. This blog is a great teacher to let go of old habits. Since i do
know that my skill in the english language isnt that  good i dont expect to deliver a perfect result.
</p>
<p>
Instead i am writing this blog post and focus on the important part which is the content, my thoughts,
ideas and the possibility to reach out to you, my readers. The first step to create a better version
of yourself is to identify the circumstances in your life that block yourself. After you identified the
problem, take your time and analyze the situation and develop strategies to turn your a problem into a
challenge which helps you to fuel your creativity.
</p>
<p>
The next time when you want to give up before you even started, tell yourself: Im doing it anyway no
matter what the outcome will be, because when i work hard i will improve and with it the quality of my
work.
</p>
<p>
You cant expect to deliver a perfect product without working hard for it. That is not how life works!
