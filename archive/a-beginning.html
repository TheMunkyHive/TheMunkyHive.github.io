Every day starts with a shiny sink. That was a line that got stuck when i was reading a blog
about decluttering. I am sure that everyone of us does have to deal with clutter sometimes
in our lifes. But where do we start ? Why not start with something that brings joy into your
life. Imagine that you come into your kitchen every morning and you will find a shiny polished
sink, free from all plates, knives, forks cups aso.
</p>
<p>
This is a bi-lingual blog written in english and german and sometimes i will mix both languages
just for fun and amusement. Life is best lived with a smile on your face and postive thoughts :-)
</p>
<p>
As i like to create things and ponder about life in general it was a native step to start writing
about it. That way i can reflect my experiences at the end of the day. By going through the whole
day im building a good foundation for the next day. You can compare it with the above example. To
enjoy a shiny sink every morning you have to put some extra effort at the end of each day after
you had your dinner time.
</p>
<p>
I am sharing with you everything that inspires, motivates, frustrates, energizes, and blocks me.
Life is so full of possibilities and challenges that i will not run out of thoughts and ideas.
As i write down my experiences i will develop my project site, this blog and my social hubs
along the journey ! It would be great if you would join me on my adventure and be part of
something new. Join me on twitter, bookmark my websites and check back regularly
</p>
<p>
Right before i was sitting down here to write this post i washed my dishes and cleaned my sink.
Im already looking forward to tomorrow when i go into the kitchen to see the surprise i worked for!
</p>
