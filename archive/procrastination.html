<div class="entry">
<p>
In the last article i have shared my view about how perfectionism is blocking my creativity and
efforts to get things done. Today i want to talk about procrastination which is an even bigger
treat for me. In the world of today where you have instant access to an overwhelming resource
of information it is very easy to get distracted. It has signs of an addiction because when you
become hooked it is always more, better and faster. You are loosing the ability to concentrate and
to focus on a particular task you are doing in the long run.
</p>
<p>
I experienced it after i quit World of Warcraft, which is a online role playing game in a fantasy
world. You have been given tasks in the game which are presented as a brief note complemented by
a very short summary of the task you are given. After y couple of years i found myself not beeing
able to read through the story driven explanation of the given task. Instead i glanced at the short
summary and went on.
</p>
<p>
It is not surprising that i havent touched a book for a couple of years now. Im not used to sit
in a comfortable chair spending an hour or two with a quality book in my hands anymore. The reason
why i dont even try to do it is simple, Distraction. I get distracted easily and fast. The smallest
things will catch my attention and my thoughts will wander of. Later i realize that i have forgotten
about the task i already started but abandoned because i found something more interesting to do.
</p>
<p>
In formal terms procrastination is the art of doing something (in your eyes) more fun an entertaining
instead of those things you have planned to do or that need to be done. Im pretty sure everyone of
us suffered from procrastination one way or another multiple times in our lifes.
</p>
<p>
There are tons of guides, tutorials, howto's on the internet which teach dozens of strategies that
are meant to help you to deal with procrastination. They are all great and theoretically helpfull
but i learned the hard way that these information will not be able to solve everything for you
instantly. As unique as your life is as unique is the solution for your problem or like i use to
call it: your challenge!
</p>
<p>
You have to find your own strategies to deal with procrastination by try and error. For me it is to
minimize distractions or just cut them out totally. That means while i am writing this blog post i
absolutely avoid browsing the web, checking emails and chatting with my friends until i am done.
Another great concept for me is following a daily schedule in the form of a todo list where i have
to cross off the tasks i have done. By going through the list i force myself to deal with those
tasks i havent touched or finished.I always write a small summary about how the day went before i go
to sleep. Reflecting the past is helping you to build a better future.
</p>
<p>
Another strategie which i plan to incorporate into my daily schedule is time-boxing. Time-boxing is
a strategy where you assign a specific timespan for every task you plan to do. I still struggle
to even start to do it because of my perfectionist nature but eventually i will get it done. I learned
to be patient with myself and not treat me to harsh because otherwise i will loose interest, motivation
creativity and inspiration.
</p>
<p>
Don&#8217;t judge yourself to harshly !
